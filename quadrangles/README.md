# USGS Quadrangles

Quadrangle map areas from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). These are primarily intended to serve as a non-trivial example of the "box" data type, as map quadrangles are bounded by straight lines in longitude/latitude space.

These data were [obtained from ESRI](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=078eb80010984ddeb4bb5850889e5e9f) and are redistributable without a Value-Added Software Application (such as, adding the sample data to an existing, non-commercial dataset for redistribution) with proper metadata and source/copyright attribution to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
